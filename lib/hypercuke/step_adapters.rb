  # Greetings, dear reader.  There's a lot going in this file, so it's

  # code I write.  I hope it helps.

  # First things first:  the point of this entire file.

  # Should you find yourself in possession of a [topic, layer] name
  # pair, this method allows you to redeem it for VALUABLE PRIZES!  (And
  # by "valuable prizes", I mean "a reference to a step adapter class,
  # if one has already been defined.")
  #
  # This method (on Hypercuke itself) is but a facade...

  # We start out with a namespace for step adapters.  As new step
  # adapter classes are created (see Hypercuke::AdapterDefinition), they
  # will be assigned to constants in this module's namespace (so that
  # they can have human-friendly names when something goes wrong and
  # #inspect gets called on them).
  #
  # Class names will be of the form:
  # Hypercuke::StepAdapters::<TopicName>::<LayerName>

    # We'll get to what makes a topic module special is in a moment, but

    # will either create a new step adapter, or return one that's
    # already been defined.

  # 1) attempt to fetch the requested thing.
  # 2) if fetch fails, define and return it.
